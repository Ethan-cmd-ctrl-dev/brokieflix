## 🚀 Getting Started (with npm)

### ✅ Add Your TMDb API Key

You need a TMDb API key to fetch movie and TV data.

#### 🔹 Option 1: Directly in Code (Recommended for Local Dev)

Open this file:

```
src/services/tmdb.ts
```

Go to **line 2** and replace the placeholder:

```ts
// src/services/tmdb.ts
const TMDB_API_KEY = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE';
```

➡️ Paste your real TMDb API key inside the quotes.

### 4. Run the website locally

```bash
npm install
npx vite
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```
